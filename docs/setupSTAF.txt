**Steps to install and configure STAF for genesis execution:**

1. Download the STAF binary from here http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/staf/STAF3426-setup-linux-amd64.bin
2. Do chmod +x STAF3426-setup-linux-amd64.bin
3. Now execute the binary
4. Use the default settings while doing the installation. 
5. Go to /usr/local/staf directory and run STAFEnv.sh, this will setup your environment for running STAF.
6. Now run startSTAFProc.sh, this will start STAF process on the server.
7. Once the above steps are successful, try following command to make sure STAF is working fine:
   root@genesis:/usr/local/staf# bin/staf local ping ping 
   Response

   PONG
   
   Here, PONG response indicates that STAF is working fine. 
8. Now if you want to execute Genesis harness remotely, you need to have STAF configured on target machine also.
   Follow the same steps to configure genesis on target machine and then run following command to make sure that STAF is able to communicate successfully with target machine:
   
   root@genesis:/usr/local/staf# bin/staf <target machine> ping ping
