**Steps to install and configure STAF for genesis execution:**

1. Download the STAF binary from here http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/staf/STAF3426-setup-linux-amd64.bin
2. Do chmod +x STAF3426-setup-linux-amd64.bin
3. Now execute the binary
4. Use the default settings while doing the installation. 
5. Add following lines in STAF.cfg.
   # Set default local trust
   trust level 5 default
   trust level 5 machine tcp://10.0.1.* #Update IP address according to your setup
   trust level 5 machine tcp://10.0.1.* #Update IP address according to your setup
   trust machine local://local level 5

5. Go to /usr/local/staf directory and run STAFEnv.sh, this will setup your environment for running STAF.
6. Now run startSTAFProc.sh, this will start STAF process on the server.
7. Once the above steps are successful, try following command to make sure STAF is working fine:
   root@genesis:/usr/local/staf# bin/staf local ping ping 
   Response
   --------
   PONG
   
   Here, PONG response indicates that STAF is working fine. 
8. Now if you want to execute Genesis harness remotely, you need to have STAF configured on target machine also.
   Follow the same steps to configure genesis on target machine and then run following command to make sure that STAF is able to communicate successfully with target machine:
   
   root@genesis:/usr/local/staf# bin/staf <target machine> ping ping 
   Response
   --------
   PONG
